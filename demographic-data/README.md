# Demographic Data Analysis

**This project involves analyzing demographic data using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python. The dataset used for analysis is extracted from the 1994 Census database.**

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to answer various questions about the demographic data using Pandas. The questions to be answered are as follows:

1. How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This information will be presented as a Pandas series with race names as the index labels.
2. What is the average age of men?
3. What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
4. What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
5. What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
6. What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
7. What percentage of people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
8. Which country has the highest percentage of people earning more than 50K, and what is that percentage?
9. What is the most popular occupation for those who earn more than 50K in India?

### Dataset
The dataset contains information about individuals, including their age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, race, sex, capital gain/loss, hours per week, native country, and salary. Each row represents an individual, and each column represents a demographic attribute.

### Project Structure
The project repository includes the following files:

demographics.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook where the analysis is done on the dataset.
adult.data.csv: The dataset file containing the information from the census.
test_module.py: Unit tests for the project functions. You can use this file to verify the correctness of your implementation.

### Acknowledgments
This project is based on the curriculum of freeCodeCamp.org, specifically the Data Analysis with Python course.
