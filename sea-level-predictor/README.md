# Sea Level Predictor

**This is a Python project that utilizes data analysis and visualization techniques to predict the global average sea level change. The project imports a dataset of sea level measurements since 1880 and uses it to generate a scatter plot, calculate the line of best fit, and predict the sea level rise in the year 2050.**

### Project Structure

The project repository includes the following files:


- epa-sea-level.csv: The dataset file containing the global average sea level change measurements.
- predictor.ipynb: The main notebook that contains the Python code that analyses the data and creates the visualization.
